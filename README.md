Lurry is a library with support for custom SQL, which allows using Groovy templates - `GString`. It enables to use groovy constructions in SQL queries. 

Lurry can use following formats for saving queries: `yaml`, `xml` and `json`. For data storage it can be used `files`, `http` and `smb`. In the future the list of formats and resources can be expanded. 

Lurry Goals: 
* Simple and convenient way to use SQL with object-oriented applications 
* Reduce count of queries
